# Implementation of a Polynomial Class
Made a polynomial class which can store, evaluate, display and add polynomial objects. Took the help of **node class** to implement polynomial as a chain of nodes where nodes are linked in increasing order of exponents.

Included suitable methods:
* `insertTerm()`
* `deleteterm()`
* `displayPolynomial()`
* `evalPolynomial()`
* `addPolynomial()`
