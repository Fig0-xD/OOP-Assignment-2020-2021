# Implementation of a Hash Class
Created a Hash class using channing with the help of LinkList class.
Generated 100 random integer values and inserted into the hash using two hashing functions:
* Modular hash function (x%10)
* `floor(hash*(fmod((val * a), 1)))`

Compared the two hashing methods by reporting the %cent load in ceach of 10 buckets.

Had to implement the following methods:
* `search()`
* `insert()`
* `delete()`
* `display()`
* `tableLoadDistribution()`
