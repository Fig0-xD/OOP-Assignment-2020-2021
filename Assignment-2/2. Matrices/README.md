# Dealing with dynamic allocation of 2D arrays

### Problem Statement

Write a program to dynamically allocate a 2-D array of size m x n and perform:
- Matrix multiplication
- Determinant of the matrix (when m = = n)

Write functions `alloc2DArray()`, `dealloc2DArray()`, `read2DArray()`, `display2DArray()`, `multMartix()`, `detMatrix()` and include them in a header file “`myMatrix.h`”. 

**You must properly call deallocation function to remove garbage**
