# Dealing with dynamic allocation of 2D arrays

### Problem Statement

Write a program that accept a set ‘n’ of linear equations ***AX=C***. Use Cramer’s rule to solve the equations. 
Input the matrix A (set of coefficients) and vector C. 
(Use the determinant function you developed in the previous version).

##### Show the output test case:
1. with 3 variables and case 
2. another where it solves a set of 20 equations involving 20 variables x_i (i=1 to 20)

**Generate the coefficients using random numbers.**
