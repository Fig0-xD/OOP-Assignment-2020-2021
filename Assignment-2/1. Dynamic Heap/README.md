# Dealing with dynamic allocation of 1D arrays

### Problem Statement

Write a program to **dynamically allocate** a 1-D array of size n to store a heap data structure.
Write functions to perform insertion, deletion operations and display on heap.
Write functions `alloc1DArray()`, `display1DArray()`, `insHeap()`, `delHeap()`, `heapify()` to solve it.
