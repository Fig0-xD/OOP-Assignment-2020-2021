# Dealing with dynamic allocation of 2D arrays; rows having variable number of cols

### Problem Statement

Write a program to store the marks (CGPA) obtained by the students from ‘n=6’ departments. 
The number of students in each department may differ. You may use an array (size equals to the number of departments) of pointers where each of its element points to 
an array (size equals to the number of students in that dept.) of integers. 
Process the marks list and display the topper in each **Department** and the **Batch** topper. Input marks using random number generator function that you implemented. 
(Use 2D array header file).
