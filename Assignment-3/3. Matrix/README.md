# Implement a matrix class 

### You should have atleast these member functions:  
* `allocatespace() `
* `readmatrix()`
* `displayMatrix()`
* `addMartix()`
* `multMatrix()`
* `detMatrix()`

Write another function `CramerRule()` which accept matrices A and C and outputs the solution of a set of linear equations (AX=C)
