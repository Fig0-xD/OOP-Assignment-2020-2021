# Implement a linear linked list class 

Performs insertion (at begining) and deletion as given the key. 

### You should have atleast these member functions: 
* initialize *(construct)*
* deconstruct
* `display()`
* `insertBeg()`
* `delete()`
* `concatenate()`
* `search()`

Show the use of the class by creating objects & calling the member functions and utilize your own random number to generate values to insert and delete.
